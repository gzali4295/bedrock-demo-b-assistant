They are currently banking with the Bing Bank and looking to bring their banking over. They cite the reason as being unhappy with the service they've been receiving for Bing Bank, but also the bank has recently closed the branch They used to bank at and the bank is not prepared to support the local community. They are unsure whether they want to continue banking with them. John and Karen have three Children Julie Penkil 25, Anna Penkel 22 Josh Penkil 17. Anna is currently studying at the University of Melbourne. Julie is, currently studying at the University of Melbourne. Also Josh is at high school and will likely start Deakin University and medicine next year. Julie Penkil may return to the farm as she was currently studying agriculture. She may return to the farm and take it over. John and Karen inherited the farm from John's parents 25 years ago. They are not looking to sell the farm. They are looking to transition to Julie over the next five years. They are there to teach and help Julie take that on. She's expressed an interest and anna and Josh have not shown any interest. The farm is roughly 307 hectares recently valued around about $10 million, largely for dairy farming, although there was a small crop. John does some import and export of dairy farming equipment. He doesn't make a lot of money from it, he says. But he is looking for the bank to help them with some exchange rate risk and some trade finance facilities as well. Currently John and Karen are selling their milk through the dairy co op. There's no direct businesses. It will go through the co op . they have a working capital facility of $4 million at least finance facility of a million dollars corporate card of $50,000. They have three checking accounts. They have roughly 2 to $3 million worth of profit each year off $30 million turnover. They are looking to bring their facilities across. If they can get an acceptable proposal from us. They're looking at no increase borrowing. At this stage. They have three homes on the property. There are four sheds. There's roughly a million dollars vehicles. The valuation of the milking equipment is around about 2 to $3 million. A lot of that has been written down.  Their accountants are Sullivan's in Shepperton, so we need to contact them to get updated financials. John has provided his approval to do that and will contact the accountants to authorise the bank to talk to them. The immediate need from the bank is to to start thinking about succession planning and how we can help them facilitate that. With Julie potentially taking over the farm.. John and Karen are the sole directors, although they're looking to bring the three Children on as directors so they want help with succession planning. They would immediately like to open a couple of small GST accounts just to start moving some of the transaction balances across. They employ some casual staff will need to look into that in terms of superannuation commitments and how we might be able to help them with that banking as well. They are also looking to build another shed on the property. They've had that valued at a million dollars. It may need some finance for that, Or they may not, too. They may use their cash balances but again needs to be decided They have no outstanding liabilities other than accounts payable, which John said at the moment is running around about $200,000 that will go up as the season increases. But then come back down again. So we look to fluctuate that. There's no need for invoice financing or factoring. The cash flow is fine in that regard, and he would like to also get a proposal from the bank to how we can support his Children, potentially in any businesses that they may want to run. John and Karen understand they need to provide updated personal financial statement position.  We need to action, the internal referrals around succession planning and to Treasury. They also would like an application form for the current for the GST accounts. We want to open but also to bring the corporate card across. They see about something they can do immediately. Next. Follow up action will be in four weeks time when I am returned to return to the farm. And John will have the details that we need to have discussed today. Actions on John to speak to the accountants and give the bank approval to contact the accountants  for financials. Action on the accountants to send the bank last years financial statements. Action on the bank to open new GST accounts, send application for commercial credit card and send referral to treasury for exchange rate hedge and succession planning"
